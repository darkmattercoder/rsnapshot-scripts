# rsnapshot-scripts

Collection of scripts to use with rsnapshot

## rsnapshot-once.php

This is a php script that I included here to show where rsnapshot-once.py originated. It was originally written by Philipp Heckel, who announced it in his blog: <http://blog.philippheckel.com/2013/06/28/script-run-rsnapshot-backups-only-once-and-rollback-failed-backups-using-rsnapshot-once/>

## rsnapshot-once.py

This is my port of the above script for python. Particularly I made it to run properly with Python version 3.4. I made some additions though.
